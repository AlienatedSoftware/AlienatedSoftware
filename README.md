Hello World! I go by @AlienatedSoftware, my day-to-day human name is Aidan. I have recently graduated in Animation, specialising in technical arts but now I have decided to fully pursue in the cybernetic simulation of code to further expand my intelligence and knowledge!

I am very interested in nature, various arts and code. I spend most of my time day dreaming and getting lost in the outside world, whilst being fasiated in virtual worlds of others' creations.

As of the time of typing this out, I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course over at Code Institute working hard to earn my diploma in Software Development!

In the future I will be working on many fun projects such as CG and technical arts, as well as fully developing my very own games and mobile applications. Bringing entertainment and joy to the world for all to see and explore. In the distant future, I hope to be able to fundamentally build my own game empire and happily retire in a nice little setllement in the middle of nowhere and become a farmer in my eldery years.
